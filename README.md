## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChatGTHB/TestingPractices_Selenium_UI.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Java and Selenium WebDriver installed on your system.
3. Install additional libraries as required by the project, such as WebDriver managers and test runners.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE.
2. Navigate through the test scenarios which include locators, CSS selectors, XPath, iframe handling, robot classes, and more.
3. Execute the test scripts from various modules to see Selenium in action.

## ✨ Features
- Coverage of basic to advanced Selenium techniques.
- Special modules on iframes, scrolling actions, robot classes, and alert handling.
- Examples of explicit waits and Selenium WebDriver utilities.

## 📦 Dependencies
- Java JDK 11 or newer
- Selenium WebDriver
- JUnit
- WebDriver Manager

## 🔧 Configuration
Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured in your IDE and build tools. Use Maven or Gradle to handle library dependencies efficiently.

## 📚 Documentation
Documentation is provided within each test script and module to explain the test setup and the specific Selenium interactions being demonstrated.

## 💡 Examples
The project includes a variety of test scenarios to demonstrate the capabilities of Selenium WebDriver. Each example is designed to showcase different techniques and Selenium functionalities. Here are some highlighted examples:

### Locators and Element Interaction
- **Basic Locators**: Learn how to use ID, class, and name locators to interact with web elements.
- **CSS Selector**: Advanced usage of CSS selectors for elements that are hard to capture.

### Advanced User Interactions
- **Action Class**: Utilize the Action class for complex gestures like drag-and-drop and mouse movements.
- **Robot Class**: Demonstrates how to use the Java Robot class for keyboard and mouse interaction beyond the capabilities of Selenium.

### Synchronization Techniques
- **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits to handle elements that take time to load.
- **Fluent Wait**: Use fluent waits to handle AJAX components more efficiently.

### Frame Handling
- **Iframe Handling**: Navigate between iframes and interact with elements within iframes.
- **Window Handling**: Techniques to manage multiple windows and switch between them.

### Automation Tasks
- **File Upload**: Automate file upload processes using the Robot class to handle native OS dialogues.
- **Scrolling**: Execute scripts to scroll through pages and interact with off-screen elements.

These examples provide a practical approach to mastering Selenium for robust UI testing. Each module within the project is accompanied by detailed comments and documentation to help you understand and apply the techniques effectively.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- Verify Java and Selenium WebDriver installations.
- Update WebDriver binaries to match the browser versions used in tests.
- Check error logs for detailed diagnostics during test failures.
